Discord core

Just an example of implementation Discord API in TypeScript.<br>
Used to be a part of another project, but now is no longer used.<br>
May be helpful to someone, who wants to write his own implementation in Discord API

Insert token in `app/token.ts`.

### Build

To build, create directory `build` and execute `tsc` in the project's root folder.<br>
Then, execute `build/index.js`.
